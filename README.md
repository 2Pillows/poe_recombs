### Results

All Recombs - Shows all recombs to get to final item using at most the same number of total desired mods. Doesn't show chances of failing to final item, 3p/3s + 3p/3s -> 1p/2s for example.
If you already have an item w/ many desired mods, like if you failed another recomb, you can check what paired item gives the best odds.

Paths - Shows the best path from 0p/0s, 1p/0s, 0p/1s to a final item. It only shows highest % chance of getting all recombs on first try, doesn't account for reusablity of items. Good for planning how to get to a final item when starting from nothing. 1p/0s and 0p/1s can be obtained from alt spamming, although other methods also work.

Cheapest Paths - The 'Cheapest Path' sheets show the cheapest way to get to a final item. These paths should provide a more realistic approach to getting a final item, without wasting multimods unless it's worth the potential loss of the base.
